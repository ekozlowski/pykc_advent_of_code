## PyKC Advent of Code

This is a "presentation" hosted at the January 28 2021 Winter Meetup of the 
PyKC Python users group.

Advent of Code is a yearly coding exercise created by Eric Wastl.  It's 
essentially an Advent calendar of coding exercises that begin on the first of 
December every year, and "count down" to Christmas.  One new puzzle unlocks 
every day, and there are puzzles from 2015-2020, making a nice collection of 
puzzles to solve.

All the years are here: https://adventofcode.com/events

Today, we'll focus on 2020, and create a directory (2020) under this directory, 
and use the Puzzles to talk about aspects of Python.
